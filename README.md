My name is Isaac Field. I am majoring in Analytics and Information Management in the School of Business and doing a math minor. A fun fact about me is that I really like playing hackeysack/footbag.

Regarding data science experience, I did a lot of very rushed work in Python's Pandas library this summer for my internship. In the beginning, I relied on ChatGPT HEAVILY. I also took two classes last semester in SQL. I'm hoping to eventually get a Masters in math or stats.

I am excited to learn more in this class!
